            <h2>What Makes a Hero?</h2>
            <p>A hero is <em>someone that does not give up</em> even when that seems like the only option. A hero is someone who is <em>willing to fight</em> battles that seem unwinnable.</p>
            <p>Someone who shows these qualities is NF, a rapper who has spent a majority of music talking about his battles with depression and a troubled mind. However, as shown in his most recent album <strong>HOPE</strong>, NF has a new outlook on life and has managed to overcome much of what has troubled him.</p>
            <p>Not only has NF used his music as a means of fighting battles against his inner demons, but his lyrics have also touched the hearts of those who understand and/or relate to what he goes through. NF has inspired many of his listeners to never give up and continue fighting.</p>
