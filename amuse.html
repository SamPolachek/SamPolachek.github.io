    <h1>The Internet is Amusing</h1>
    <h2>Give us a Laugh, ya Dog</h2>
    <p>When it comes to humorous content on YouTube, groups of people will challenge each other to not laugh at dad jokes. An example of this is the YouTube channel "<strong><em>YeahMad</em></strong>", where two members of the group tell each other dad jokes and have to take a shot everytime they laugh.</p>
    <p>Linked below is quite possibly one of their funniest videos, as the people telling the jokes are also the most susceptible to laughing out of the group.</p>

    <h2>Sometimes It's the <em>Classics</em> that Get us</h2>
    <p>It's not just YouTube that is a good place for one to find good dad jokes. The Internet also has some of its own on various webpages. Some of them are pretty lame, but there will always be one that gets you laughing.</p>

    <h2>Comedy in Movies/TV Shows</h2>
    <p>Jokes are always a pleasure for people to tell one another, but rest assured, there is no shortage of comedy in other forms of media, specifically movies and TV shows. A particular movie I'm thinking of is "<strong>Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</strong>", as it features Kevin Hart basically being Kevin Hart. There's not much else to say there.</p>
    <p>Linked below is a compilation of some of the funniest moments from the aforementioned film.</p>
